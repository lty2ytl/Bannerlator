/**
 * One normalized download/library row.
 *
 * The two byte pairs mirror the Steam detail page's two-bar model exactly, so the
 * Steam producer ([com.winlator.star.store.SteamDepotDownloader], Phase 2) maps in
 * 1:1 from its `DownloadProgress:appId:iDone:iTotal:dDone:dTotal` event:
 *   - [installDone]/[installTotal]  — uncompressed bytes written to disk
 *   - [downloadDone]/[downloadTotal] — compressed bytes fetched over the network
 * [pct] is the overall percentage (Steam uses the install fraction, clamped 0..99
 * until INSTALLED); other stores that only expose a single percentage can set [pct]
 * and leave the byte pairs at 0.
 *
 * ## Pause / cancel action handles
 * [pause]/[cancel] are held as transient lambdas ON the entry rather than in a side
 * map. Rationale:
 *   - `copy()` (used by every [DownloadRegistry.update]) preserves them for free, so
 *     a producer attaches them once at queue time and they survive every progress
 *     mutation without extra bookkeeping.
 *   - the Compose consumer (Phase 3) reads `entry.cancel` / `entry.pause` directly,
 *     no lookup indirection.
 *   - they are plain object references: cheap to copy, and — critically — NEVER
 *     persisted. Only INSTALLED rows hit prefs, and the library writer serializes
 *     only [name]/[store]/[installPath]/[cover], never these handles.
 * The Steam engine hands back a `DownloadControl(cancel, pause)`; the producer simply
 * wires `cancel = control.cancel::run`, `pause = control.pause::run`.
 *
 * @property id store-native id as a string (Steam appId, Epic appName, GOG gameId,
 *   Amazon productId). Stringly-typed so all stores share one model.
 * @property cover whatever a store needs to render its art — a Steam appId-derived
 *   url, a GOG/Amazon/Epic image url, or null. Nullable string key/url by design.
 * @property installPath filesystem path once INSTALLED (persisted to the library).
 * @property error human-readable failure reason when [state] is FAILED.
 * @property supportsPause whether this store's engine can pause+resume (Steam: true).
