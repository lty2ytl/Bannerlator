/**
 * Steam-side seeding for the cross-store Download Manager (Phase 2).
 *
 * Bridges the Steam DB into the store-agnostic [DownloadRegistry] so the Library
 * section isn't empty on first open: every already-installed Steam game (the
 * `steam_games` rows with `is_installed = 1` and a real `install_dir`) is upserted
 * as an INSTALLED entry, which the registry persists to its durable library.
 *
 * This lives on the Steam side ON PURPOSE — the registry imports zero Steam types.
 * All Steam knowledge (the DB, [SteamRepository], the appId→cover convention) stays
 * here; the registry only ever sees normalized [DownloadEntry]s.
 *
 * Call once at Steam startup, right after [SteamRepository.initialize] and
 * [DownloadRegistry.init] (see [SteamForegroundService]). Idempotent.
