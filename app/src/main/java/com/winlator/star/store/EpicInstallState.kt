 * Single owner of Epic's native install record (the `bh_epic_prefs` keys that encode "installed").
 * Epic has no DB — install-state lives entirely in these prefs, and THREE surfaces read them: the
 * store list ([EpicGamesActivity]), the detail page ([EpicGameDetailActivity.refreshActionState],
 * `epic_exe_ != null`) and the seed ([EpicLibrarySync]). So every uninstall — from the detail page
 * OR the cross-store Download Manager — must clear the SAME keys, or a surface goes stale. Direct
 * mirror of [AmazonInstallState] / [GogInstallState].
 *
 * Lives on the Epic side ON PURPOSE so the store-agnostic `download` package keeps importing zero
 * store engines — the Manager Activity / hooks call INTO this, never the reverse.
