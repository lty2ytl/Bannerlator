package com.winlator.star.store.download

/**
 * Thin, store-agnostic write shim over [DownloadRegistry] for the Java-fed store
 * Activities (Amazon now; GOG / Epic later).
 *
 * Steam wires the registry directly from Kotlin ([com.winlator.star.store.SteamDepotDownloader]),
 * so it doesn't need this. The other stores drive their downloads from a Java engine
 * (`AmazonDownloadManager` etc.) with only an Activity-side callback seam to hook — and
 * three of them would otherwise copy-paste the same `"$store:$id"` key construction and
 * the same `upsert`/`update` boilerplate. This object centralises exactly that:
 *   - one place builds the store-qualified key (must match [DownloadEntry.key]);
 *   - one place maps a store's simple "pct + aggregate bytes" callbacks into the
 *     normalized [DownloadEntry] the shared registry + Compose screen expect.
 *
 * All calls are no-ops-safe: [DownloadRegistry.update] silently ignores an absent key,
 * so an out-of-order progress/complete tick can never NPE. ARCHITECTURE: this stays in
 * the `download` package and imports zero store engines — the store Activities import it,
 * never the reverse.
 *
 * As well as feeding the in-app Download Manager, every call here also drives the shared
 * [DownloadForegroundService] so all non-Steam stores get a shade notification + a process
 * kept alive across backgrounding, for free: [registerDownload]/[tick] push the notification
 * line, and the terminal transitions ([markInstalled]/[markCancelled]/[markFailed]) drop it.
 */
