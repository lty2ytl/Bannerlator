/**
 * Store-agnostic foreground service that keeps the process alive while ANY non-Steam store
 * download is running, and surfaces a live progress notification in the system shade.
 *
 * This is the direct analogue of [com.winlator.star.store.SteamForegroundService], but for
 * the cross-store Download Manager: Steam already had its own FGS (which also keeps the CM
 * connection up); Amazon (and, later, GOG / Epic) downloads had NO foreground service, so
 * backgrounding the app or destroying the store's detail Activity could kill them. Every
 * store that routes through [StoreDownloadHooks] now inherits this for free.
 *
 * Design (mirrors SteamForegroundService):
 *   - process-static [instance] handle so [StoreDownloadHooks] can push updates without a bind;
 *   - a process-static [active] map (key → latest line) that is the source of truth for the
 *     notification. It lives in the companion, not the instance, so a progress tick that
 *     arrives a hair before onStartCommand publishes [instance] is never lost — onStartCommand
 *     rebuilds the notification straight from the map.
 *
 * Lifecycle: [StoreDownloadHooks.registerDownload] calls [start] + [setProgress]; each tick
 * calls [setProgress]; each terminal transition calls [finish]. When the last active download
 * finishes, the service removes its notification and stops itself.
 *
 * NOTE (POST_NOTIFICATIONS): the runtime notification permission is already requested globally
 * by MainActivity / SteamMainActivity, so no per-download prompt is needed here — if the user
 * denied it the notification is silently dropped by the framework but the download (kept alive
 * by the FGS + [DownloadScope]) still completes.
